Pattern Matching - 1:
Which of the following will match?
– a = [1, 2, 3] --MATCH
– a = 4 --MATCH
– 4 = a --MATCH
– [a, b] = [ 1, 2, 3 ] --DOES NOT MATCH:  error message
      a 1x2 array can't match a 1x3 array
– a = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]  --MATCH
– [a] = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ] --MATCH
– [[a]] = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ] --DOES NOT MATCH:  error message
      stating that the first element of the array is equal to all three elements of the second array (I think)

Pattern Matching - 2:
Which of the following will match?
– [ a, b, a ] = [ 1, 2, 3 ] --DOES NOT MATCH
– [ a, b, a ] = [ 1, 1, 2 ] --DOES NOT MATCH
– [ a, b, a ] = [ 1, 2, 1 ] --MATCH

Pattern Matching - 3:
The variable a is bound to the value 2. Which of the following will match?
– [ a, b, a ] = [ 1, 2, 3 ] --DOES NOT MATCH
– [ a, b, a ] = [ 1, 1, 2 ] --DOES NOT MATCH
– a = 1 --MATCHES because reassigns the variable(?)
– ^a = 2 --MATCHES because a is bound to 2
– ^a = 1 --DOES NOT MATCH
– ^a = 2 - a --DOES NOT MATCH

However, if I type it into iex like row for row, we come back with:
iex> a = 1
1  --MATCH
iex> ^a = 2
:Error --DOES NOT MATCH
iex> ^a = 1
1  --MATCH
iex> ^a = 2 - a
1
