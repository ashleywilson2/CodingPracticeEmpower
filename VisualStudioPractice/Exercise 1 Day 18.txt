Exercise 1 Day 18:

Use a file system folder as a database.
Create any class you with (such as Pet), and write many "records", where a single record is a single file in the folder.
Create methods in your application to read and write those classes (in JSON shape).
Use LINQ to perform queries over objects that are being read from the operating system.
Be creative!
